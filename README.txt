Sports Hub template

What you get
1. index.html basic page with three sections
2. style.css simple styling
3. script.js fetches Football, Chess, and F1 data

Setup
1. Open script.js
2. Replace REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY with your key from https://www.football-data.org/
3. Save files

Run locally
1. Double click index.html to open in a browser
2. If football stays empty you likely forgot the API key
3. Chess and F1 should work without a key

Deploy for free
Option A Netlify

3. If something still fails open DevTools then check the Console for errors
